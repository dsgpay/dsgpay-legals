### **Schedule 2 Fee Schedule**

**1. Currency Conversion:**

Our Services include the ability to convert currencies, for example:

**(a)** As part of a Disbursement.
**(b)** In your Dollarsmart Global Virtual Account, when you add money in one currency and then later use those funds to send money to a third party in another currency. 
**(c)** In your Dollarsmart Global Virtual Account, when you hold a balance in one currency and then convert it to a different currency.

**Exchange rate.** When we refer to an exchange rate in this Agreement, it means the exchange rate at the relevant time for the relevant currency pair (for example, GBP to EUR, USD to AUD) that is offered by Dollarsmart Global, which is typically provided by a reference rate provider and usually the mid-market exchange rate. We may change our reference rate provider from time to time without notice to you.

For some currencies, we do not use the mid-market exchange rate, including where we are required by law to use a different reference rate for the exchange rate for your currency pair. For these currencies we will notify you of the exchange rate offered by Dollarsmart Global when you initiate a current conversion.

We may not process your currency conversion order until we hold or have received the funds and specified fees. It is your responsibility to ensure money that you fund a currency conversion order (whether through your Dollarsmart Global Virtual Account, or as part of a Money Transfer or any other Service we provide) in a timely manner. We cannot be responsible for the time it takes for the money to be sent to us by your bank or payment service provider.

Out-of-Market Quotes – a) If we quote you a Rate that is clearly a mistake on our part ("Out-of-Market Quote") as the result of a technical or human error, it is not binding on us. You must notify us as soon as the mistake comes to your attention and we will requote the Rate as soon as possible.

Adverse market rate movement – If we quote and you accept a rate and either the underlying FX mid rate for that currency pair we quote you and you have accepted has moved by more than 2% against us after 24 hours we have the right to cancel the transfer and ask you to rebook a new transfer;

FX Rates - You acknowledge that exchange rates can fluctuate rapidly and that we constantly update our quoted FX Rates. We will quote you a dealable Foreign Exchange ("FX") rate when you enter your transaction and receive a Transaction ID from us.

Transactions Beneficial Rate Movement: If the FX Rate in between the time the Transaction is placed and when we receive your funds moves for you we will not pay you any of the difference.

FX Rate Source - we have sole responsibility to determine what FX rates will be used to determine any FX Rate we display to you. Our FX rates will update in real time or any period we deem suitable.

Intermediary and Beneficiary Banking Fees and Charges: We may use third party suppliers and Intermediary and Beneficiary banks who may deduct fees from your transaction. Given the huge number of possible correspondent and beneficiary banks and their different charging methodologies, we are unable to advise you of the amount of these fees and charges at the time you entering the online transaction. It is your responsibility to contact your beneficiary’s bank to determine any fees and charges they may levy on your transaction.

**Refusing a currency conversion order.** We reserve the right to refuse any currency conversion order if the conditions set out in this Agreement have not been met. 

**Confirmation of currency conversion order.** Each currency conversion order is given a unique transaction number.
